			<p>This is my weather forecasting application made with AngularJS. It uses OpenWeatherMap's API to get weather data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. This project is inspired by and an extension of Anthony Alicea's course, Learn and Understand AngularJS.</p><br />
			<p>I have one module named weatherApp. I have two controllers, homeController and tableController. The homeController sends a 'get' request and gathers the 10 day forcast for the searched city. The tableController sends 'get' requests for the ten largest populated U.S. cities. There are two services - cityService sets the initial city to New York, NY, while dataService uses $resource to call OpenWeatherMap's API.</p>
